# Daylight

The minimalistic browser, fully open source.

We don't recommend using the dev environment when running Daylight. The code that runs in the dev environment is unoptimized and will most likely be slow. Build it, then run. 
This is a Proxathon 2024 entry.

## Official Instance
The official instance (demo) is available [here[(https://daylight-prod.vercel.app). (do not believe whatever link is in the description, that is outdated.)

## Deployment

To run the Daylight demo, first clone the repo by running: 
`git clone https://github.com/NightProxy/Daylight`
Then, go into the newly created folder, named Daylight.
`cd Daylight`

Then, run this code:
`npm i && npm run dyl`
Replace npm in the above code with pnpm, yarn, or bun corresponding to your package manager of choice.

After you've successfully ran it with no issues, Daylight will be available at localhost:8080.
