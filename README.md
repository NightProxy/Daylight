# Daylight

The minimalistic browser, fully open source.

We don't recommend using the dev environment when running Daylight. The code that runs in the dev environment is unoptimized and will most likely be slow. Build it, then run. 
This is a Proxathon 2024 entry. 
Instructions to run this for yourself (using the github repo) will arrive later after the competition has ended.
